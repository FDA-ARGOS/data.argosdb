README Summary for Data Dictionary V1.4																										
"- In 'data_files' column: '*' implies all files in that data set category from Mazumder, Pond, and Crandall Labs."																										
																										
Major Changes to V1.4 Data Dictionary 																										
Action 	Affected Datasets 	Justification																								
Dataset name change	non-core_propoerty_list.tsv' was renamed 'annotation_propoerty_list.tsv'|'SRA_biosample.tsv' was renamed 'biosampleMeta_NCBI.tsv' 	The renaming is a more appropriate description of the dataset and it's contents. 																								
"New dataset added, and new terms added and defined"	property_list.tsv|annotation_property_list.tsv|DRM_all_orgs.tsv	The annotation dictionary is expanding due to new protocols and datasets.																								
Datasets were archived; terms not in use were removed from the data dictionary	proteome_metadata.csv*|uniprot-proteome.csv*|SRA_biosample.tsv|PRJNA231221_AssemblyUpdated.tsv|property_definition.tsv|annotation_property_list.tsv	Terms or datasets are reomved if they are not in use or represented in data.argosdb.org. Previous versions of the data dictionary can be referenced if a term is pulled back into use. 																								
Statsitics section of 'Release Notes' updated 	release_notes.tsv|README.tsv	To maintain data dictionary metadata.
