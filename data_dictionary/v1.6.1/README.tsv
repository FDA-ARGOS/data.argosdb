V1.6.1 FDA ARGOS Data Dictionary README		
		
Description: 		
List of controlled vocabulary terms for data.ARGOSdb.org datasets and data properties. 		
This data dictionary was created to aid in the integration of ARGOS data from many disparate sources.		
Each of the column headers in each of the respective data sheets displayed on data.ARGOSdb.org was recommended by project members and collaborators from the FDA.		
The resulting list was manually curated to combine similar terms, and provide a consistent representation across all datasets in data.ARGOSdb.		
The primary use case for the data dictionary is to ensure all data submitted to data.argosdb.org is following a consistent representation of the data properties.		
The draft dictionary is maintained as a excel file for project members to contribute to.

Clustering algorithm for representative genomes		
1. Search https://www.uniprot.org/ for species name, pull representative genome, if it exists		
2. If not, search the rpg-75.txt file (from here) for that species name		
3. Pull the top level proteome		
  a. Example: searching for Bordetella bronchiseptica shows up under Bordetella pertussis, which is UP000002676, so pull that proteome		
  b. This will be the representative_proteome_uniprot_acc value		
  c. The species name that was used to search is the representative_genome_org		
4. Using the proteome (whether directly from UniProt or indirectly through PIR), map it to the representative genome		
  a. This can be done via UniProt under the "Components" section: "Genome accession(s)" (which links out)		

  b. This is the representative_genome_acc, and is why it might be different from the genome_assembly_id
