V1.4 FDA ARGOS Data Dictionary README		
		
Description: 		
List of controlled vocabulary terms for data.ARGOSdb.org datasets and data properties. 		
This data dictionary was created to aid in the integration of ARGOS data from many disparate sources.		
Each of the column headers in each of the respective data sheets displayed on data.ARGOSdb.org was recommended by project members and collaborators from the FDA.		
The resulting list was manually curated to combine similar terms, and provide a consistent representation across all datasets in ARGOSdb.		
The primary use case for the data dictionary is to ensure all data submitted to data.argosdb.org is following a consistent representation of the data properties.		
The draft dictionary is maintained as a excel file for project members to contribute to. 		
After a final review, all datasets listed here downloaded, QC'd with test scripts, converted to .tsv, published to data.ARGOSdb, and are saved in the respective versioned directory in GitHub.
