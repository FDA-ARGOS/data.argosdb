# README For the HIVE3 Code for the Data Push

#All code in this folder is for the data push to argosdb. 
# It will take in a folder of jsons for each of the categories (qcAll, ngsQc) etc and spit it out as a tsv. You will alos need to 
# download the columns json that is specific for the type of output in order for the code to work. 

#Each code script has information information in the beginning about what each script does as well as comments throughout the script
#to show you what needs to be inputted.

#This has to be run locally in order for it to work. This type of code has been setup for MacOs. 
# You will need to alter some code for a PC/Windows laptop. 

#If you have any questions, reach out to Christie Woodside.
