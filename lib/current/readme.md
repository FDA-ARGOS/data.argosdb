# README
The code scripts here are what are used for the data table formation.
- They are current as of May 22, 2025

NOTE: 
- Use biosample_metadata_grabberV4 for the newest tables/computations. Now that we don't have the assembly ID in the JSONs anymore this fixes it
Biosample_metadata_grabber_V3 is in the lib folder outside of current
- Also use ngsQC_datatable_V2.sh for the newest computations
