Influenza A virus	A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1)	GCA_000865725.1	211044	ERR2096902	Yes	List of SRA IDs retrieved using search string in SRA "txid211044[Organism:exp]". The SRA ID was selected based on NCBI search filters Source: RNA, Type: genome, Library layout: paired, Platform: Illumina. Project National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV) UK sequences well-characterised, authenticated human pathogenic viruses.	-	HIVE Lab	ngsQC_HL
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2	Wuhan-Hu-1	GCA_009858895.3	2697049	SRR10971381	Yes	SARS-CoV-2 original isolate from human lung metagenome from Wuhan.	-	HIVE Lab	ngsQC_HL
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2	B.1.1.529/Omicron isolate	-	2697049	SRR17309642	No	For omicron, we are selecting EPI_ISL_6913953. Sequencing was conducted on  Illumina MiSeq, has high coverage, and a consistent quality score across all base calls above 30. Raw reads are available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX13486794, and a full description of the patient harboring the virus is supplied with the following publication https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab1072/6494531?login=true. The patient was one of the first two known COVID-19 cases classified as omicron in Japan. To put the collection date of 28 November 2021 in perspective, the first known omicron sample was collected on 8 November 2021. Raw reads from South Africa are available, but the average phred quality score is much lower for those samples.	-	Pond Lab	-
